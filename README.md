# CheckInApp
A simple GUI in python using tkinter to enter the info of visitors into a retirement complex. The data is then sent to a .csv file, which can then be further used for data scraping or just as display, all the data is shown there nicely. In an event that someone, a manager or such, must be notified, the email feature serves that purpose too. Also has an autofill feature, which searches the Registered.csv file to see if the name matches with anyone there and auto-fills the info. 
Added an Admin Tab to add people to the Lookup file.
